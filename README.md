## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.x+
- Dart 3.x+
- Android Studio or Xcode
- Backend server running (see server README)

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moinkhokhar1/NextPay.git
cd NextPay/nextpay
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure API URL

Edit `lib/services/api_service.dart`:
```dart
// For Android emulator
static const String baseUrl = "http://10.0.2.2:8000/api";

// For physical device (use your machine's IP)
static const String baseUrl = "http://192.168.x.x:8000/api";
```

### 4. Run the app
```bash
flutter run
```

## 🔄 How Offline Works

```
User sends payment (no internet)
        ↓
Balance locked locally (SharedPreferences)
        ↓
Transaction signed with SHA256
        ↓
Saved to pending_transactions_{userId}
        ↓
Internet restored → NetworkMonitor detects change
        ↓
Auto-sync POST /sync/transactions
        ↓
Server validates SHA256 signature
        ↓
Balance updated — receiver gets funds
        ↓
Local storage cleared
```

---

## 🔐 Offline Security

Every offline transaction is signed before saving:

```dart
final payload = {
  'txId': uuid,
  'sender': senderId,
  'receiver': receiverId,
  'amount': amount,
  'timestamp': timestamp,
  'nonce': nonce,
  'status': 'pending',
  'synced': false,
};
final signature = sha256(jsonEncode(payload) + SECRET_KEY);
```

The backend verifies this signature before processing — tampered transactions are rejected.
